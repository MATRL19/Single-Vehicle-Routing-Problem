### Single Vehicle Routing using RL
This repository provides code for the Single Vehicle Routing problem. This problem is solved using linear approximation and non-linear approximation (Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest). 
### How to use this code
The required classes for each method is stored in a seperate file. To run each method, its enough to download the related file and the Train and Test folders which contains sample train and test files then run the code using python3. The list of files is as follow:

- [Linear Approximation](LinearApproximation.py) 
- [Non-linear Approximation using Artificial Neural Network](NeuralNetwork.py)
- [Non-linear Approximation using Random Forest](RandomForest.py)
